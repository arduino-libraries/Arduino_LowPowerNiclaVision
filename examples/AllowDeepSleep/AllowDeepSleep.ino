*
* This example shows how to allow Deep Sleep on the Portenta H7.
*
* The blue LED turns on first, for 5 seconds. The delay is performed with a call
* to delay(), which will trigger Sleep Mode automatically. Then, the red LED is
* turned on for an amount of time that equals the time spent in Sleep Mode. The
* expected behavior is that these two delays should be roughly equal.
*
* Next, the sketch makes a call to allow Deep Sleep Mode. It then turns the blue
* LED on for 5 seconds again, using a delay() call exactly as last time. Next,
* the green LED is turned on for an amount of time that equals the time spent in
* Deep Sleep Mode. The expected behavior is that these two delays should be
* roughly equal.
